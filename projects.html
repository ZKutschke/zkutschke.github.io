					MIT Solar Electric Vehicle Team: Nimbus
				</h3>

				<p class='content'>

					</p>

				<p class='content'>
					I joined the team for the full build cycle of the car affectionately dubbed Nimbus. As part of the mechanical sub-team, I helped to design components of the braking system and rear suspension as well as run simulations and calculations to make sure our designs were safe. I also gained a fair amount of experience using mills, waterjets, welders, and programming CNC machines.

					I did a lot of work in designing the parking brake (to the left), which is basically just putting a lever arm and a locking/release mechanism on a hydraulic cylinder. I also worked on redesigning some of the geometry for the rear suspension. Originally we planned (and made) our rear suspension's L-arm out of two pieces of steel to be welded together. After having to actually machine the parts and learning first hand how terribly they were designed (in part by yours truly), I redesigned the connection point between the two parts such that it would suffice to make it from aluminum (and be simpler to machine).

					BD Medical Automated Bag Tester
				</h3>

				<p class='content'>
					The first portion of my internship at BD Medical consisted of testing a lot of these small reservoir bags for their new wearable insulin delivery device. The whole process of testing these bags was time consuming and inefficient, so in the 50 seconds between each test I slowly designed a robotic arm and fixture to automate the testing.

				<p class='content'>
					After doing some testing and revisions of the structural components, I arrived at the design shown to the right and below. It has two lead screws to drive the lift and tray, a rack and pinion for the arm, and two air cylinders for clamping and advancing the bag into the CTS instrument for pressure decay leak testing. I also put together the control/power circuitry and programmed it with an Arduino.

				<p class='content'>
					After completing the project I put together a report and further designs for a faster and more flexible tester for their operations team to follow up on. I completely failed to take into account how underpowered my motors were when I ordered them (I did some back of the napkin calculations for a rough size but didn't account for how much friction there would be in the system). I also chose to actuate the whole things with stepper motors and lead screws, even though it would have been 100x faster and more precise to slap some simple pnuematic cylinders in because I did not clarify with my boss what my budget actually was for the project (and a cheap stepper + threaded rod is 10x less expensive than a decent linear actuator).

					MIT 2.007: Moonshot
				</h3>

				<p class='content'>
					2.007 is the MIT class with complementary robotics competition that spawned FIRST Robotics. The 2019 competition, Moonshot, mainly involved traveling down a series of ramps, picking up rocks, and getting back up to the starting position (along with some other possible scoring objectives along the way). 
				</p>

				<img src='images/2007/2007_bot.jpg' style='max-height: 30%; max-width: 30%;' class='center'/>

				<p class='caption'> Collapsed version </p>

				<p class='content'>
					My robot was designed to get down the ramp, pick up a handful of rocks in a bin, and then lift up that bin and shoot it out into the starting area for the points. It was also made to pull a multiplier (a 6lb weight). I learned a ton about design throughout the class while iterating and testing different ideas and concepts for the bot.

				<p class='caption'> Nice shot of the old transmission </p>

				<p class='content'>
					I'll admit, I got pretty ambitious with how many of the scoring elements I wanted to take a crack at. I quickly realized that if I wanted to get a faster robot I had to give my drive train at least half of my motors. That only left me three motors to yank a 6lb weight, collect a bunch of rocks, and raise them up a few feet (and all in under two minutes or so). 

					My solution? I made a transmission with the remainder of my motors. It was pnuematically actuated, included some handmade dog gears, and was strong enough to take a finger.

				<p class='content'>
					I also had a few cracks at making a proper chassis. The first attempt I failed to take into account the fact that thin sheet aluminum distorts really easily when bent, rendering it completely dimensionally inaccurate. I finally landed on a good 3 part chassis, a few iterations in.

				</div>

				<p class='content'>
					I also needed a means of collecting rocks that didn't require additional motors, so laser cut this little ratchet assembly and tied my drive train to the collector. The ratchet was so that the collector would only operate when I was driving forward and not fling the rocks back out when I went backwards.

				<p class='content'>
					All in all, this robot didn't actually come together by competition day. I got very ambitious and tried to do a lot of different relatively complicated things rather than just focusing on moving rocks from point A to point B. But I still got to learn a lot about design and manufacturing, and had a lot of fun building this.

					Musashi Auto Parts: Rolling Machine Shop
				</h3>

				<p class='content'>
					The floor of Musashi Auto Parts-MI is fairly large, and so whenever a new machine or production line is put in it’s kind of a pain since all of the tools and equipment are typically in the engineering department or maintenance room (on the opposite end of the plant from the new lines). Hence, I was tasked with making a cart that contained all of the goodies that might be needed in machine installation.
				</p>

				<img src='images/Rolling_shop/map_cart2.jpg' style='max-height: 30%; max-width: 30%;' class='center'/>
				<p class='caption'> View of the cart 1</p>

				<p class='content'>
					I helped design the cart and presented the concept to the other engineers in the department with a fellow intern (Joanna Robinson). Another intern (Michael Campbell) helped me with welding the frame while I made more of the pieces/components. Aside from that I fabricated, machined, welded, and wired the rest of the cart.  It should save the engineers doing the line installations tens of hours per week collectively just by having all of the equipment and parts in one place. 
				</p>

				<p class='caption'> View of the cart 2 </p>

				<p class='content'>
					The cart had a bunch of fanciful features, including a fold-out work surface, extension ports, overhead lights, a drill press, a vice, and a grinder.

				<p class='caption'> View of the cart 3</p>

				<p class='content'>
					The plan was to also have the sides and center of the cart filled with electronically locked tool boxes. Unfortunately, the lead time on these tool boxes meant that I could not finish the project in time to go back to school. The touch pad on the center post of the cart was supposed to control power to all of the machines and the locks on all of the tool storage locations so that none of the more curious line workers would get curious and lose a finger or walk off with a new angle grinder.

				<p class='content'>
					The cart itself is an absolute unit, designed and handmade (mostly) by yours truly. The top work surface is a half inch thick slab of AR500 plate topped off with a layer of stainless steel sheet. The rest of the cart is all steel tubing and sheet metal thick enough to make an industrial sheet metal brake cry a little.

					Musashi Auto Parts: Gear Subassembly Leak Testing
				</h3>

				<p class='content'>
					The Musashi Auto Parts (MAP) plant in Battle Creek, MI, manufactures components for and assembles automotive differentials. It was super cool since the side gears for the differentials were made <em>in house</em>. Giant lengths of steel billet and the actual housings went in one door and out of the other came finished differentials.

				<p class='caption'> A nice leaker </p>

				<p class='content'>
					The problem that MAP had was that its side gears were leaking. They are fitted with a cap before assembly that's supposed to ensure that differential fluid does not leak out of the assembly. But a handful would leak anyway, so they needed a means of testing them in production. Ergo, my summer project.

					With the supervision of one of the lead engineers I made an apparatus that would allow me to take factory air, stabilize it to some degree, run it through a machine to measure its flow rate, and lead all of that to a clamp that would seal the gear and flow analyzer together.  The setup also allowed me to fill the gears up with pressurized water for a fluid loss test.

				<p class='caption'> Almost finished </p>

				<p class='content'>
					The piston valve hybrid cannon was a concept I saw on YouTube a few years ago and always wanted to build. It replaces the rupture disc normally used in ‘hybrid’ cannons with a piston to more finely tune the opening pressure of the chamber. I haven’t actually gotten a chance to mess around with it too much but its theoretical maximum velocity is around 1500ft/s with a standard golf ball.

				<p class='caption'> Cross section of the valve </p>

				<p class='content'>
					The piston is pretty simple and works off of a pressure differential between the rear pilot area and the chamber. Since there's a large difference in exposed areas between these two sections, it becomes possible to control the opening of the valve with a much smaller volume and pressure.

				<p class='content'>
					I used this program called HGDT (hybrid gun design tool) to roghly spec out the dimensions of my chamber and barrel and get rough estimates of the muzzle velocity. For an AP physics project I also put together my own model to estimate the muzzle velocity and energy that was pretty close to HGDT's output and could be tuned once I had actual data from my cannon.

					Foundries and Melting Metal
				</h3>

				<p class='content'> 
					For a while I have been messing around with metal casting. I had made a foundry that ran off propane but it was somewhat fragile and the cost of propane was getting to be too much for my budget. Another energy source I looked into for a while was used motor oil, which, thanks to a well-placed ad on craigslist, I had obtained 50 gallons of. 

					I initially tried dripping the oil into an airstream to atomize it, but I couldn’t get that to work. At some point I tried vaporizing the oil and pressurizing it but that didn’t work at all. After that I tried pressurizing the oil and just combining the oil and air lines in a junction right before the nozzle, which turned out to work for the most part.

					For the foundry itself I basically dug a hole in the ground and lined it with cinder blocks and bricks that I had lying around. The largest melt I attempted in my makeshift pit was about 10lbs of aluminum, though the entire apparatus supporting the pressurized oil and air rig is very cumbersome. To try and improve my setup speed and mobility I have been experimenting with a siphon nozzle and a Delavan nozzle. 

					In my quest to make a cheaper (propane is not cheap when you have no income) and easier to use (less than 1 hour set up time) foundry, I experimented with resistance forges. I basically stuck an electric stove’s heater with a steel shell into a pile of perlite and contained the whole thing in a cardboard box. It’s honestly amazing that the perlite was a good enough insulator to keep the box from catching on fire, even though the chamber reached somewhere around 1600F

					Me and my friend James George entered and competed as finalists in the international Conrad Spirit of Innovation Challenge in 2016-2017 with our project “H2Ouse”. H2Ouse (which we couldn’t really figure out how to pronounce, but we made a pretty cool logo for) is a combination greenhouse-mini desalination plant using a fairly novel renewable fuel source. When we looked at areas of the world experiencing water stress we noticed two things: that a majority of these nations bordered some body of salt water and that a significant portion of the water draws for a lot of these countries was going towards agricultural irrigation. 
					
					H2Ouse consists of two main parts, the first is a large fermentation tank where people can load organic waste and was meant to provide fuel to the greenhouse portion of H2Ouse, which would use it to desalinate sea water for plant irrigation

					VEX: Starstruck
				</h3>

				<p class='content'>
					I have participated in VEX robotics throughout high school with the Battle Creek Area Math and Science Center team, and in 2016-2017 I was the captain.
					
					The robot that year consisted of a normal 4 wheel base, a 4 bar lift, and a large claw-type gripper to manipulate and lift game elements. The goal of the game that year was to take these large, oddly shaped stars and squishy cubes and fling them over a fence to the opponents’ side of the mat. I used Inventor to make diagrams and sketches of the robot in an attempt to be able to readily delegate work to other team members.
					
					We didn’t make it terribly far into the competition but we were able to pretty handedly manipulate a lot of game elements simultaneously and quickly (we just couldn’t lift our robot up for the extra points).

					Burst Disc Hybrid Cannon
				</h3>

				<p class='content'>
					My dad made one of those traditional PVC and hair spray ‘spud guns’ when I was little and for whatever reason it really captivated me. So throughout elementary and middle school I messed around with making compressed air cannons and such things. The burst disc hybrid cannon was like my introduction to more serious oddball projectile lobbing. With the disc and butane/air mix a fairly precise chamber pressure can be achieved as well as predictable velocities/muzzle energies (with a marble the muzzle velocity tends to top out at around 1800ft/s).
